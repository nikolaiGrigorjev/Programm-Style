    <div class="card-header">Behavior-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) 
          is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, quality assurance testers, and customer 
          representatives in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from test-driven development (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas 
          from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.</p>

  <div class="card text-white bg-secondary mb-3" style="max-width: 40rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Design-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Design driven development uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to build better, more informed technology solutions. It can also be
           looked at as a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application. This leads to products that people enjoy using and want to tell others about.</p>

  <div class="card text-white bg-success mb-3" style="max-width: 40rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Domain-driven design</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach  focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.

        In terms of object-oriented programming it means that the structure and language 
        of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example, if a software 
        processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw. </p>

  <div class="card text-white bg-danger mb-3" style="max-width: 40rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Secure by design</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Secure by design, in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure.
        Alternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software design, and the best are selected and enforced by the architect
        ure, and they are used as guiding principles for developers. It is also encouraged to use strategic design patterns that have beneficial effects on security, even tho
        ugh those design patterns were not originally devised with security in mind. </p>
